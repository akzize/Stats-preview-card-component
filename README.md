### Useful resources

- [overlay color over an image](https://dev.to/ellen_dev/two-ways-to-achieve-an-image-colour-overlay-with-css-eio) - This helped me for putting the violet color layer over the image actually i've struggled with it because i've used <picture> tag so i did't know how to solve it. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.


- [you can know more about Responsive web here](https://web.dev/learn/design/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Responsive web. I'd recommend it to anyone still struggling in this concept.
